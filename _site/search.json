As of today, I do not have any personal projects to post here, nor do I have relevant work experience. Furthermore, my classroom projects excluding the ones finishing up now this quarter are stuck in local folders on my old computer that is currently in San Francisco. However, I will be working on projects in Spring quarter and working with data in my internship this summer, so check back here in 6 months for a catalog of data science projects!"
