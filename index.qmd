## About Me

Hello! My name is Taig and I am a senior at UCLA majoring in both Economics and Statistics & Data Science. I graduate in December of 2024 and am excited to begin my professional journey in the intersection of business and data science. This summer I embark on the next step in my career as a Business Analyst intern for CarMax in Richmond, Virginia. Attached is my current [resume](/docs/Resume/Taig Lonergan Resume.pdf "Resume") for anyone interested.

Outside of the lecture halls, I am President of Special Olympics at UCLA and serve as Treasurer of the UCLA Men's Club Soccer team. I enjoy living an active and healthy lifestyle, which includes cooking, running, and playing soccer with anyone and everyone. I am a lifelong Manchester United fan and you can find me most Saturday mornings at 7am watching us lose to a team in the relegation zone.

Feel free to explore this website to learn more about me personally, academically, and professionally!
